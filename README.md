# Handz

An virtual (and anonymous) show of hands.

## Why?

Because sometimes you want to gauge your audience by getting a show of hands, but:

1. You can't _see_ everyone's hands (e.g. there are remote participants)
   or
2. Folks aren't comfortable raising their hands (e.g. they're embarrassed by their answer)

## The Solution

Let your audience submit their responses anonymously (solves #2) with their phones (solves #1)!

Handz makes that _really_ easy!

1. Find an audience and share your screen (this is the hardest part)
2. While the world is watching, go to [handz.live](https://handz.live) and click "Start"
3. A 4-digit code will appear on your screen along with the text: "Waiting for responses..."
4. Instruct everyone in the audience to go to [handz.live](https://handz.live) and to enter the 4-digit code
5. They'll see two big buttons: 🙋‍♀️ and 🙅‍♂️.

That's it! Now just ask your question out loud (no need to type it in to the app) and let folks anonymously choose whether their hand is up or down. The results will instantly appear on your device as they come in.

### Do you have multiple questions?

Great! There's no need to start a new Handz session. Just click the "clear-results" button in order to start with a clean slate.
